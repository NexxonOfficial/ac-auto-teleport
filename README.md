# Auto Teleport

An Auto Teleport script that lets you instantly teleport your vehicle to a teleporter of your choice using a custom keybind.

## Features

Instant Teleportation: Press your configured keybind to teleport back to the pits, then automatically warp to your desired teleporter when your vehicle comes to a stop.

Server‑Side Teleporter List: Uses the game’s built‑in teleporter list (managed server‑side). No need to maintain or update a client‑side list.

Seamless Integration: Works with any online server supporting the standard teleporter system.

## Installation

Download the latest Release folder from this repository.

Open your Content Manager and drag the downloaded .zip file into the window.

Click Install when prompted.

Launch the game and join any online server.

Open the App Shelf, navigate to Your Apps, and click on Auto Teleport to enable the script.

## Usage

Join an online server that has teleporters available.

Simply press your binded button that was set in the app and it will take you back to pits, and then teleport you to your teleporter set afterwards.
Why does it take you back to pits instead of going straight to the teleporter? AC requires the user to stop completely before going to the teleporter, hence why we return you back to pits to stop your vehicle, then teleport you there.
Don't worry, though, you only have to press the bind once and it'll automatically do the work for you - no more double bind presses.

## Configuration

Currently, the list of available teleporters is managed by the server and cannot be modified from the client side. All teleporters exposed by the server will appear in the teleport menu.

## Known Limitations

Teleporters cannot be added or removed client‑side — they must be provided by the server.
As far as we know, you can't set the vehicle in motion which was the original plan. However, will continue to attempt to find a way to do this.
